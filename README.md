# Newsletter-SignUp
This site is a simple newsletter signup page that allows users to enter their email address and subscribe to a newsletter. The site is built using Node.js and is hosted on Render.

(I accidentally made a mistake of leaking the API key for mailchimp, they revoke it so now I can't track who has subscribed.. I know it's an easy fix but that doesnt affect the work of the site and it's okay to learn from mistakes.)

To run the site locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/newsletter-signup.git

2. Navigate to the project directory using the following command:
  cd newsletter-signup

3. Install the dependencies using the following command:
  npm install
  
4. Start the development server using the following command:
  node app.js

5. Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the site.
